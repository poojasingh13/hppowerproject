<b>Under  Implementation</b>
					 <h5>Anuppur  Thermal Power Project</h5>
 The thermal arm is developing 2520 MW  coal based Thermal Power project in  Anuppur district, Madhya Pradesh. The  project is planned to be executed in two phases as follows:<br/><br/>
                                             <strong>Phase -  1</strong>: 1200 MW (2X600 MW)<br/>
                        <strong>Phase - 2</strong>: 1320 MW (2X660 MW)<br/><br/>
                      It is currently  implementing the first phase of 1200 MW (2X600 MW) through its SPV (Special Purpose  Vehicle) i.e. MB Power Madhya Pradesh Limited (MBPMPL). Coal for the project  will be sourced from South Eastern Coalfields and water will be sourced from  River Son. <br/><br/>
                       The company has set new  benchmarks in the power sector by achieving critical mile stones (in terms of  land acquisition, coal and water linkage, securing various statutory and other  clearances and award of various contracts) in a record time. 
                      <br/> <br/>The Company has already  achieved financial closure of Phase-1 of this project and construction work is in advance stage. Development of the Phase-2 of the Project is scheduled to be taken up  shortly subject to coal availability tie up. <br/><br/>

<h5>Chhattisgarh  Thermal Power Project <strong>(Birra Thermal Power Project)</strong></h5>
                      The thermal arm is developing a 1320  MW (2X660 MW) coal based super critical project in district Champa, Chhattisgarh. The project marks the company&rsquo;s entry into the state which has 18  percent of the country&rsquo;s coal reserves.<br/><br/>
                  The company is actively pursuing various  pre-developmental activities, land acquisition is in  advance stage and various approvals &amp; statutory clearances are also in  place to start the construction works immediately after financial closure is  achieved.<br/><br/>

                     In addition, thermal arm also  plans to develop projects in coal rich states like  Jharkhand, Odisha etc.<br/>
                  Apart from thermal generation,  the company also has plans of making a foray into power transmission,  distribution and other associated businesses through strategic tie-ups with  other players.<br/><br/>
